For Loop

Purpose: Primarily used for iterating through a sequence of items, such as a list, tuple, string, or a range of numbers.
How it works:
The loop automatically iterates over each item in the sequence, assigning each item to a variable within the loop.
The loop continues until all items in the sequence have been processed.
Best suited for: Situations where you know the number of iterations beforehand or when you need to process each element in a collection.
While Loop

Purpose: Repeats a block of code as long as a specific condition remains true.
How it works:
The loop checks the condition before each iteration.
If the condition is true, the code within the loop is executed.
The loop continues to repeat as long as the condition remains true.
