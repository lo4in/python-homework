The break and continue statements in Python are used to control the flow of loops.

break:

When encountered, the break statement immediately terminates the entire loop, regardless of whether the loop's original condition is met.
Execution then proceeds to the first statement after the loop.
continue:

When encountered, the continue statement skips the rest of the code within the current iteration of the loop.
The loop then proceeds to the next iteration.
